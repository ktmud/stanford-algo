## Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1

This repository is used to log my personal progress while learning the Coursera course [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/Algorithms) by Tim Roughgarden.

It will includes answers to the programming questions, mostly wrote in JavaScript, and may also include a few notes, regarding the content of the course, or pitfalls seen during debugging my code.

Please always try solve the questions on your own before looking into the answers.
