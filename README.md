## Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1

This repository is used to log my personal progress while learning the Coursera course [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/Algorithms) by Tim Roughgarden.

It will includes answers to the programming questions, mostly wrote in JavaScript, and may also include a few notes, regarding the content of the course, or tackled pitfalls when debugging my code.

Please always try to solve the questions on your own before looking into the ugly code of mine.
